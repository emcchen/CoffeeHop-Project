# CoffeesHop
CoffeesHop is a full-stack web application built to locate coffee shops and cafes that distinguish themselves as a safe and welcoming space to everyone, with gender neutral restrooms inside! Users can search for shops by entering in a location and view business names, along with customized markers on a map. An optional section to leave a review with an attached photo lets users leave their experience with the shop and also scroll through other reviews.
